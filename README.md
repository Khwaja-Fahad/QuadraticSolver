# QuadraticSolver

The QuadraticSolver repository contains a simple C program that solves quadratic equations. It takes user input for the coefficients (a, b, and c) of a quadratic equation, calculates the discriminant, and then determines and prints the roots of the equation. The program also handles cases where the discriminant is negative, indicating that the quadratic equation has no real roots.
